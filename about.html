                    I greet you with open arms! This is my humble digital abode. My name is Byron Joseph Abt. I am an independent film Producer, Director, Cinematographer, and Editor. I am currently employed by the University of South Carolina Upstate as the Director of Video Services within Athletics full time. I manage their day to day creative and live broadcast video operations. I Produce and Direct their video board and live ESPN+ broadcasts. <br><br>
                        I earned my Bachelors of Science in TV and Film production from the University of SUNY Fredonia. From there I worked my way through the independent film production industry. I produced(and still produce)wedding highlight videos, short films, commercials, and music videos. Through my work I was able to receive an opportunity at the University of Missouri as a part of their SEC Network Broadcast department. I started off as a Utility and worked my way up the ladder to Lead Utility, Camera and finally Lead Camera Operator. 
                        <br><br>I worked with the University of Missouri from Aug 2014-Sep 2017.
                        In August of 2015, I was recommended for a professional camera operating freelance position. And so, for the last three and a half years, I have worked as a professional camera freelancer for ABC, a Disney ESPN affiliate. 
                        <br><br>My work has taken me across states and to numerous sports; from gymnastics to baseball, softball, swimming, tennis, cross country, golf, track, basketball and football. However, my aspirations have always resided within becoming a Director for ESPN.
                        In the Fall of 2017 an Opportunity at the University of South Carolina Upstate came into fruition. I was again recommended for the position and was promptly hired. As the Director of Video Operations within Athletics, I have been able to tap into the independent creative production side as well as the Director and Camera Operator of my profession. 
                        <br><br>I have been given an opportunity not only to hone my skills and develop my Directing skills, but to also develop future live broadcast employees. All of my broadcasts are produced for the Big South Network on ESPN+.
                        <br><br>If your interest in my work resides in my Broadcast Directing and Producing experience, or if you have any interest in hiring me for a wedding, music video, short film, or corporate production, please fill out the form on the "Contact me Tab".
                        I thank you for your interest in my work and career path.
